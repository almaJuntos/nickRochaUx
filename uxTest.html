  <h1>Hipmunk: How can user testing increase the usability of the website?</h1>
    <p>There are many travel websites that help the user find amazing prices when planning
       their next vacation or business trip. However, there are different types of travelers
       based on travel criteria and purpose. Hipmunk is a travel website that allows users
       to book flights, hotels, and rental cars. It finds travel options that are easy to
       understand based on user need and what they are purchasing. The Hipmunk mantra is,
       “Don’t let travel planning drive your nuts!”</p>
  <div class="son">
    <div>
  <h2>Design Problem</h2>
    <p>Can frequent travelers use Hipmunk to
       plan their next trip?</p>
     </div>
     <div class="aih">
       <p><img class="reb" src="/Users/owner/Documents/nick_rocha_portfolio/img/pdx_Rebel.jpg"><br>Let Hipmunk set you FREE!</p>
     </div>
   </div>
  <h2>Methods</h2>
    <p>The frequent travelers were users who purchased travel accommodations in the last year
       and have not used Hipmunk. The recruitment population was created from travel
       networks by sending out text messages with the following criteria questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Have you ever used Hipmunk to purchase travel accommodations?</li>
      <li>How often did you travel in the last year?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The population included two participants who were diverse in travel frequency, complexity
       of travel criteria, and comfort to making travel plans online.</p>
<div class="son">
  <div>
  <h3>userMunk1</h3>
    <p>“I fly 3-6 times a year."</p>
    <ul>
      <p>Travel criteria:</p>
      <li>Low cost</li>
      <li>Direct flight</li>
      <li>Space (aisle seat)</li>
      <li>Bag cost</li>
      <li>Airline type for seat upgrade</li>
    </ul>
    <p>“I have certain airlines that I will not fly so<br> I will pay more money
       to fly the ones that I prefer.”</p>
    </div>
  <div class="aih">
  <h3>userMunk2</h3>
      <p>“I only fly once a year.”</p>
      <ul>
        <p>Travel criteria:</p>
        <li>Low cost</li>
        <li>Direct flight </li>
        <li>Price range</li>
      </ul>
      <p>“I am not most computer oriented.”</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h4>The test used the following tools:</h4>
  <div class="lem">
      <ul>
        <li>User test script – It maintains a protocol for communication between
           moderator and users during the test.</li>
        <li>Pre-test questionnaire - It identifies overall user needs to travel
           and using online travel services.</li>
        <li><a class="chy" href="/Users/owner/Documents/nick_rocha_portfolio/img/reportTemplateHipmunk.pdf">Task instructions – </a>It gathers data about how users navigate Hipmunk

        <li>Debrief questionnaire – It identifies website improvements while gaining
           overall feedback about the website after use.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h4>The test used the following data analysis tools:</h4>
    <div class="lem">

        </ul>
      </div>
    <h2>Findings + Recommendations</h2>
    <h3>Summary of Results</h3>
      <p>The user test observed participants completing six tasks
         using Hipmunk website. The overall findings are based on
         function view ability and memory tax overload when using
         the site. The recommendations for key findings are directed
         to interface content and function placement.</p>
      <div class="son">

        <div class="aih">
      <h3>userMunk2:</h3>
        <p>“There is too much on the website that may be more complex
           when looking for a flight.”</p>
        </div>
      </div>
        <p>The task were mapped to users’ completion and time rate to
           describe website efficiency when making travel decisions.</p>

    <h3>Key Findings</h3>
      <h4>Finding 1:</h4>
        <p>In task 1, the users were not able to find the email button on the Hipmunk
           website to send travel itinerary to other parties. Once the users selected a
           complete trip, they are directed to another tab away from the Hipmunk website
           (See figure 1). The users thought they needed to fully purchase the ticket before
           having an email option based on past travel experiences on the web.</p>

      <div class="son">
        <div>
     <h5>userMunk1:</h5>
       <p>“I need to book it then send the email.”</p>
     </div>
     <div class="aih">
     <h5>userMunk2:</h5>
       <p>“Where is the send email function?”</p>
     </div>
   </div>

   <div class="lem">
     <br>
       <img src="/Users/owner/Documents/nick_rocha_portfolio/img/munkFindOne.jpg">
     </div>
       <p>Figure 1: The users are directed to a different tab where they purchase the ticket
          from the airline company website.</p>

    <div class="lem">
       <img src="/Users/owner/Documents/nick_rocha_portfolio/img/munkFindTwo.jpg" style="width:600px; height:132px;">
     </div>
       <p>Figure 2: The Hipmunk website places the email itinerary function on the top right
          of the flights results page.</p>

    <h4>Recommendation:</h4>
      <p>“Matching between system and real world  (Nielson, 1994), “ is the ability to use common
         logic to complete user tasks within the interface. A development change to the website
         will allow the user to remain on the Hipmunk site after finding a complete flight.
         The email itinerary function should change font size and color so the function is more
         visible to the user.</p>

    <h4>Finding 2:</h4>
      <p>During task 4, the user was tasked to find how many trip options are found within a specific
         time frame. The Hipmunk website provides a time gage function that allows the user to complete
         the task (See figure 3). Munk1 was able to use the gage function while Munk2 did not understand
         its overall purpose. However, in both cases, the users were unable to find the selected number of
         trips content (See figure 4) without scrolling down Hipmunk website and counting the total flight
         options by hand.</p>

      <div class="urm">
      <h5>userMunk2:</h5>
      <p>“I am starting to get confused!”</p>
      </div>
      <div class="lem">
      <img src="/Users/owner/Documents/nick_rocha_portfolio/img/munkFindThree.jpg">
    </div>
    <p>Figure 3: This is the time gage function on the Hipmunk website.</p>
      <div class="lem">
      <img src="/Users/owner/Documents/nick_rocha_portfolio/img/munkFindingFour.jpg">
    </div>
      <p>Figure 4: The Hipmunk website provides a total of flights selected on the top left of the page.</p>
      <h4>Recommendation:</h4>
      <p>The number of trips selected content is not viewed by the user in
         regard to location and font color. By using Gestalt properties to associate like items,
         we can change the number count to green as seen in Figure 4. The location will also
        benefit user visibility by placing this content below the “Sort by” drop down menu.</p>

    <h4>Finding 3:</h4>
      <p>The Hipmunk website allows the user to compare other travel websites to price. The main
         screen of the website gives the user different travel sites after selecting your type
         and time of travel (See figure 5). However, after selecting the search button, the other
         travel sites open in a completely different window that is minimized and hard to locate
        (See figure 6).</p>
    <div class="lem">
      <img src="/Users/owner/Documents/nick_rocha_portfolio/img/munkFindFive.jpg">

    </div>
      <p>Figure 6: The Hipmunk website displays the travel site comparisons in a new window at
         the bottom, right corner of the website.</p>
      <h4>Recommendation: </h4>
      <p>Using “aesthetic and minimal design (Nielson, 1994),” it will allow the
         user to see important content. The travel site comparison function needs to be created
        within the Hipmunk website. The design will take a tab browser model that is next to the
        other selected travel fairs in Hipmunk.</p>
    <h3>Limitations</h3>
      <p>The limitations of the test are related to population size and possible bias from the
         participants. These limitations were found based on time and first time learning conditions.
         Here are some suggestions for future user test for Hipmunk</p>
    <div class="lem">
      <ul>
        <li>The participant group should be 5 – 10.</li>
        <li>The participant should adhere to the specific target population.  </li>
        <li>The participants should be independent from the user test moderator.</li>
        <li>The user test tools (ex. computer type) should be consistent with every participant.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>The user test explored how frequent travelers navigate the travel website, Hipmunk.
         The test used pre-test questionnaire, six user tasks, and a debriefing session with
         each user. The key findings were based on function view ability and memory tax overload
         when using the site. The recommendations for key findings were directed to interface
         content and function placement. The overall usability from the participants shows an
         average response.</p>
    <div class="son">
      <div>
      <h5>userMunk1</h5>
        <p>“ This is pretty user friendly.”</p>
      </div>
      <div class="aih">
      <h5>userMunk2</h5>
        <p>“It shows cheaper airfare.”</p>
      </div>
    </div>
        <p>The people who use travel websites are looking for an experience that is easy to view,
           have transparent content, and have the ability to shop around with other travel sites.
           The Hipmunk website is in a good place to amend the minor key findings that will further
           support ongoing users.</p>
