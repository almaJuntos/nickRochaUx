  <h1> Outreachy: How a website concept moves to prototype?</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Outreachy is a non-profit organization that offers a three-month internship
       for software engineers. Their mission “supports diversity within free and open source
       software” by working with women, people who are transgender, and people of color.</p>
  <h2>Design Problem</h2>
    <p>Outrechy has discovered that many applicants start but do not complete the application.
      The current website uses a lot of text to define application tasks that are confusing
      and inefficient to the user. Our goal is: </p>
    <img class="lem" src="/Users/owner/Documents/nick_rocha_portfolio/img/outOrgDos.png">
    <p><b>How can Outreachy’s interface be more intuitive so more applicants complete their internship application?</b></p>
    <h2>Ideation</h2>
  <div class="dea">
    <div class="com">
    <p>This internship program has a six-week application process where applicants complete
        these steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Eligibility form</li>
      <li>Four essay questions</li>
      <li>Final application form</li>
      <li>Choose/contribute to an open source project</li>
    </ul>
    <p> To make sure those tasks were included in the prototype, I conducted a brainstorming session to define the tasks needed to complete the application process. The column on the right is the categories that will be included for the sketch project. The triangle (3) post-it notes on the left have identified the population and characteristics of the website users.</p>
    <p>The 20-sketch project focused on designing a front-page interface for the students. It will allow the applicants to learn about Outreachy and immediately start applying for the program. <a class="chy" href="/Users/owner/Documents/nick_rocha_portfolio/img/twentySketchesOutreachy.pdf">20 Outreachy Sketches</a></p>

    <h3>User Test</h3>
    <p>The user test was completed by five participnats in a task flow scenerio from start the application, sign-up, apply, and fid a project. The work flow was then broken down to idividual tasks for the participants to complete. Here is the work flow prototype we tested from:</p>

      <h3>Recommendations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The first time users will immediately find the “Sign-up” button.
            It is important to have this button in the top or middle of the
            page so users can immediately start the application. There could
            also be “Sign-up” or “Log-in” buttons on this page to only provide
            the user two options. The “Sign-up” button will take the user to the
            sign up form while the “Log-in” button will present log in fields when
            clicked.</li><br>
          <li>The “eye” icon, that shows text of the password when written, was used
             to gain password requirements (i.e. 8 characters, 1 upper case…). To make
             a distinction between two tasks, the password requirements will be placed
             to the right of the password fields. When each requirements is made then it
             changes to green to signify the password requirements are met<br> In addition,
             the “eye” icon was hard to view in the prototype. This may be the reason why
             the icon was used incorrectly by the user. It is necessary that all icons have the
             same size so everyone can view and use them. </li><br>
          <li>The size of the buttons should be cohesive to size so users can differentiate
             between different tasks on the screen. </li><br>
          <li>The various screens need to have a title at the top of the page.
            The go back “x” icons are known for phone screens while an “->” icon may be more
             appropriate for computer screens when navigating from page to page on the wusebsite.</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>The prototypes tested had an overall success rate of 90%. In addition, we debriefed test participants who felt confident to start and sign-up when apply for the internship. We also observed that the minimal design of the UI can be a plus when making sure applicatants complete the application. It was this type of design that will allow users to be independent to complete their applicattion but will have a help tool so they can ask questions along the way.</p>
