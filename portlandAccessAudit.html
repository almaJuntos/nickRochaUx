<h1 class="arleen">UX Heuristic Evaluation: How Coursera's discussion forum meets usability guidelines?</h1>

   <div class="intro">
     <div class-"tro">
       <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In UX design, we are building relationships between people and technology. With this in
           mind, problems will occur so ongoing evaluation is important. A heuristic evaluation uses
           usability principles to describe user problems and recommend design changes to the interface.<br><br>

          Coursera is an online educational platform where learners can accomplish degree programs,
          certificates, and individual classes. It uses a discussion board so students can learn and
          interact online. We are now going to take a deep dive into Coursera's
          discussion board by using Jakob Nielson's Heuristics.
          </p>
        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>One hour evaluation</li>
            <li>Usability problem and location</li>
            <li>Heuristic violated</li>
            <li>Description of problem</li>
            <li>Severity scale</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Severity Scale</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cosmetic problem</li>
            <li>Minor usability problem</li>
            <li>Major usability problem; important to fix</li>
            <li>Usability catastrophe; imperative to fix</li>
        </ol>

      <h3>Finding 1: The “Search” icon is displayed but inactive.<br>
      Heuristic Violation: #5 Error prevention<br>Severity: 3</h3>
      <p>In the discussion board, there is a search box so students can find past threads. The result of
      the search topic includes two icon options, “delete” and “search.” The search icon is non-clickable
      and students have to use the go back arrow to search again. The inability to use the search
      icon affects the student’s work flow while creating task frustration and fatigue.</p>

    <h3>Recommendation</h3>
    <p>The interface should use a prevention system where bugs are addressed before the
      user finds the problem. The “delete” button can be fixed or displayed as shown in the
       search interface below.</p>

    <h3>Finding 2: There is no “cancel” button when replying to a thread.<br>
      Heuristic Violation: #3 User control and freedom<br>
      Severity: 3</h3>
    <p>The student has two options when posting a discussion thread, new and reply. A new thread
       includes “cancel”and “post” buttons while the reply post does not include a “cancel” button.</p>
    <p>The student needs ability to navigate from posting a thread based on choice and response to
       error within the interface. Without the “cancel” button, the interface is not consistent with
       student task ability throughout the discussion board.</p>

<div class="findOne">
  <div class="club">
    <h3>Recommendation</h3>
    <p>A “cancel” button should be added to the reply thread as shown in the interface
      below. In addition, the use of the “x” icon below can be added to delete text
      in the “Body” of the thread.</p>

    <h3>Finding 3: Incorrect menu icon between parts of the interface.<br>Heuristic Violation: #10 Help and documentation<br>Severity: 3</h3>
    <p>The student finds help with the discussion board through the “Help Center” on Coursera. It includes
    help articles about different topics. The “Get Help with Course Content in the Discussion Board” article
    shows how to “Edit or delete forum posts.” However, the article has different menu icon buttons from
    the interface. The interface should use consistent symbols based on student tasks.</p>

    <p>The “Help Center” article should be updated and match the<br>menu icon used in the
    interface.</p>

    <h3>Finding 4: The “edit” and “delete” buttons are hard to find.
      <br>Heuristic Violation: #6 Recognition rather than recall”<br>
      Severity: 2</h3>
      <p>The student is allowed to “edit” and “delete” posts after they have been submitted to the forum.
      These two buttons are located in the right corner of the post with a carrot like menu icon. The menu
      icon hides the needed buttons of “edit” and “delete” so students have to remember where these two
      functions are located. This violation affects new students and people who use a screen reader that
      may not be able to find and read.</p>

    <h3>Finding 5: The “link to post” button does not give feedback.<br>
      Heuristic Violation: #1 Visibility and system status<br>
      Severity: 2</h3>
    <p>When students reply to different posts, they are offered options to gain response after they
    post. One option is “link to post.” The post option is verbally
    direct but it does not show visible completion. Without this additional
    information with the “link to post" function, the student does not know how and when to use
    this response option when replying to another post.</p>

    <p>The “link to post” option should show the path, in student’s terms, and the path can
      turn green when completed.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p class="tro">Coursera's forum board has usability problems that need fixed. It is important to prioritize
  heuristic findings based on severity, things need fixed. In addition, there would be more than one evaluator (3-5) to
  be most effective in finding usability problems. The evaluation would then be presented in a debriefing meeting
  to further brainstorm redesign options and recognize positive aspects of the interface.</p>
