      <p>I'm a UX designer who combines social work and front-end web development.
        My passion is to learn how people build relationships with technology.
        By using Human Centered Design (HCD), I want to help users find solutions for products and
        services they can access everyday. Here is my current design lunch box:</p>

  <h2>My Road Into UX</h2>
  <div class="col">
      <p class="slt">Biology/Psychology<br><br>I studied biology and psychology because I'm an analytical
         thinker who values the scientific method (Who, What, When, Where, and Why). I now can use UX research
         techniques when solving physical and behavioral health problems.</p>
      <p class="sli">Social Work<br><br>I identified people's needs through interviews,
         assessments, and documentation. I use empathy to meet people where they are which further
         developed services and programs that meet service users goals, continued use, and ongoing use in the
         future.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="col">
      <p class="sly">Front-End Web Development<br><br>My intro in front-end web development merged
         design and development. I now can communicate and understand different problem solving
         methods when creating design systems that are collaborative and efficient.</p>
      <p class= "slo">UX Design<br><br>I moved into UX design because I want to further my social
         science background and create tech products that are used everyday. I believe
         that people who are closest to the problem are closest to the solution when improving
         products that maintain need, use, value, and adaptation.</p>
   </div>
   <div>
      <h2 id="tit">My Design Process</h2>
      <p>A good design is a regenerative process between users and stakeholders. It is not created
         in an executive conference room based on one brilliant idea. Design is a non-linear process
         that uses active communication and collaboration between each team member. My goal as a
         UX designer is to advocate for users' needs when defining organizational goals for products or services. </p>
